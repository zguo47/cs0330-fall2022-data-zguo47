Your goal is to modify your copy of bits.c so that it passes all the
tests in btest without violating any of the coding guidelines.

***********************************************************
1. Modifying bits.c and checking it for compliance with dpc
***********************************************************

IMPORTANT: Carefully read the instructions in the bits.c file before
you start. These give the coding rules that you will need to follow if
you want full credit.

Use the dpc compiler (./dpc) to automatically check your version of
bits.c for compliance with the coding guidelines:

    ./dpc bits.c

dpc returns silently if there are no problems with your code.
Otherwise it prints messages that flag any problems.  Running dpc with
the -e switch:

    ./dpc -e bits.c  

causes dpc to print counts of the number of operators used by each function.

Once you have a legal solution, you can test it for correctness using
the btest program.

*********************
2. Testing with btest
*********************

The Makefile in this directory compiles your version of bits.c with
additional code to create a program (or test harness) named btest.

To compile and run the btest program, type:

    make btest
    ./btest [optional cmd line args]

You will need to recompile btest each time you change your bits.c
program. When moving from one platform to another, you will want to
get rid of the old version of btest and generate a new one.  Use the
commands:

    make clean
    make btest

Btest tests your code for correctness by running millions of test
cases on each function.  It tests wide swaths around well known corner
cases such as Tmin and zero for integer puzzles.

When btest detects an error in one of your functions, it prints out the
test that failed, the incorrect result, and the expected result, and then
terminates the testing for that function.

Here are the command line options for btest:

    ./btest -h
    Usage: ./btest [-hg] [-r <n>] [-f <name> [-1|-2|-3 <val>]*] [-T <time limit>]
        -1 <val>  Specify first function argument
        -2 <val>  Specify second function argument
        -3 <val>  Specify third function argument
        -f <name> Test only the named function
        -g        Format output for autograding with no error messages
        -h        Print this message
        -r <n>    Give uniform weight of n for all problems
        -T <lim>  Set timeout limit to lim

Examples:

    Test all functions for correctness and print out error messages:
        ./btest

    Test all functions in a compact form with no error messages:
        ./btest -g

    Test function foo for correctness:
        ./btest -f foo

    Test function foo for correctness with specific arguments:
        ./btest -f foo -1 27 -2 0xf

btest does not check your code for compliance with the coding
guidelines.  Use dpc to do that.

*******************
3. Testing with driver.pl
*******************

The driver.pl script uses both btest and dpc to compute the correctness and performance points for your solution. It takes no arguments:

./driver.pl

driver.pl will be used to evaluate your solution. This is what we use in the autograder, so feel free to run it locally before uploading to Gradescope. 

*******************
4. Helper Programs
*******************

We have included the ishow program to help you decipher integer
representations. It takes a single decimal or hex number as an
argument. To build it type:

    make

Example usages:

    ./ishow 0x27
    Hex = 0x00000027,	Signed = 39,	Unsigned = 39

    ./ishow 27
    Hex = 0x0000001b,	Signed = 27,	Unsigned = 27

************************
5. Compilation Problems
************************

If your program does not compile locally with the error:

fatal error: bits/libc-header-start.h: No such file or directory

Run the following in terminal/command prompt.
    sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib

This will install a version of gcc for compiling 32-bit programs.
Since Data is all about manipulating bits, it's integral you use
32-bit integer representations when solving the puzzles!

6. Written Questions
**********************
Please answer and explain your answers to the following questions.
These questions will be graded by hand after submission.

1. What is the smallest positive non-zero value that can be
represented as a normalized double-precision number? How much
larger is the next smallest value?

2. What is the smallest positive non-zero value that can be
represented as a denormalized double-precision number? How much
greater than this is the next smallest value?
