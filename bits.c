INTEGER CODING RULES:

	Complete the body of each function with one
	or more lines of C code that implements the function. Your code
	must consist of a sequence of variable declarations, followed by
	a sequence of assignment statements, followed by a return statement.

	The general style is as follows:

	int funct(...) {
		/* brief description of how your implementation works */
		int var1 = expr1;
		...
		int varM = exprM;

		varJ = exprJ;
		...
		varN = exprN;

		return exprR;
	}

	Each "expr" is an expression using ONLY the following:
	1. Integer constants 0 through 255 (0xFF), inclusive. You are
	   not allowed to use big constants such as 0xFFFFFFFF.
	2. Function arguments and local variables (no global variables).
	3. Unary integer operations ! ~
	4. Binary integer operations & ^ | + << >>

	Some of the problems restrict the set of allowed operators even further.
	Each "expr" may consist of multiple operators. You are not restricted to
	one operator per line.

	You are expressly forbidden to:
	1. Use any control constructs such as if, do, while, for, switch, etc.
	2. Define or use any macros.
	3. Define any additional functions in this file.
	4. Call any functions.
	5. Use any other operations, such as &&, ||, ==, -, or ?:
	6. Use any form of casting.
	7. Use any data type other than int.  This implies that you
	   cannot use arrays, structs, or unions.


	You may assume that your machine:
	1. Uses 2s complement, 32-bit representations of integers.
	2. Performs right shifts arithmetically.
	3. Has unpredictable behavior when shifting an integer by more
	   than the word size.

EXAMPLES OF ACCEPTABLE CODING STYLE:
	/*
	 * pow2plus1 - returns 2^x + 1, where 0 <= x <= 31
	 */
	int pow2plus1(int x) {
		/* exploit ability of shifts to compute powers of 2 */
		return (1 << x) + 1;
	}

	/*
	 * pow2plus4 - returns 2^x + 4, where 0 <= x <= 31
	 */
	int pow2plus4(int x) {
		/* exploit ability of shifts to compute powers of 2 */
		int result = (1 << x);
		result += 4;
		return result;
	}
